## How To Run
Run the server using npm start in the mock directory. when you go to the port opened (mine is 8000) you should see our interface. Type your desired command into the command line, then press the button. There are four commands:
* mode -- switches from brief mode, which will just return the <output>, to verbose mode, which will return your command as Command: <command> and the output as Output: <output>.
* load_file <filepath to CSV> -- this will load the CSV you want to view/search. Will return a message stating whether the CSV could find the filepath or not.
* search
* view
